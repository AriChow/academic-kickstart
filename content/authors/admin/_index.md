Aritra is a Research Scientist in the Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence Group at GE Research.

He is responsible for working on computer vision problems across different businesses including Aviation, Healthcare, Power, Transportation (currently a part of Wabtec). He is also an integral part of GE Research's external portfolio. In this role, Aritra is actively pursuing government funding opportunities by working on fundamental research problems in AI and computer vision leading to publications and grant proposals. These problems include the abstract grounding problem in AI using logical and symbolic methods, to bespoke problems in computer vision.

His research interests lie in the reconciliation of the disparate areas of artificial intelligence - particularly symbolic, logical, bayesian and connectionist approaches.

His current work involves research in artificial intelligence with a focus on image analytics and computer vision. He has significant extensive academic and industrial exposure in developing research prototypes at RPI, IBM Research and GE Research.

Prior to joining GE Research, he was at GE Healthcare working on developing deep learning solutions for specific healthcare problems. Aritra completed research internships at GE Research and IBM Research before joining the organization as a full time researcher.

Aritra has published several papers in top international conferences and journals in AI, computer vision and medical imaging, and has been involved with patenting novel technology in Healthcare, Transportation, Aviation and Power. Aritra has a Ph.D. and M.S. in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and a B.E. in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from Jadavpur University, India.
